### User Story:
<hr />
<p>“As someone with an ailment looking for relief, I want a website  that’ll give me recommendations for strains suited for my symptom. When I am presented with a list of recommended strains I can click on each of the names. When selected, I am presented with the flavor profiles and descriptions of of each strain. I am also presented with a list of holistic home remedies, to pair with my strains.”</p>


### Product Desciption:
<hr />
<p>Warning we are not medical professionals! This app is not meant to treat medical illnesses.</p>

<p>This app has been created between four full stack developer students. Using the tools we've learned and/or self taught, we've built this app to recommend medical marajauna strains for the user's ailments. Based off the user symptoms, certain medicinal cannabis strains are reccomended. The recommendations for medical marijauna are selected and pulled from a server side API (The Strain API).
Along with cannabis strains, a selection of herbal home remedies are also recommended to the user. Those holistic remedies are sourced and pulled from another server side API (Nutridigm API).</p>
