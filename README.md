Product Desciption

Warning we are not medical professionals! This app is not meant to treat medical illnesses.

This app has been created between four full stack developer students. Using the tools we've learned and/or self taught, we've built this app to reccomend medical marijauna strains for the users' ailments. Based off the user symptoms, certain medicinal cannabis strains are reccomended. The recommendations for medical marijauna are selected and pulled from a server side API (The Strain API).
Along with cannabis strains, a selection of holistic home remedies are also recommended to the user. Those holistic remedies are sourced and pulled from another server side API (Nutridigm API).
